        <h1>Government Interference should be Required to Protect User Privacy</h1>
        <p><small>By: Daniel Garcia</small></p>

        <p>A growing number of companies are starting to be able to spy and collect private/sensitive information from consumers. A big “Privacy Awakening” happened during the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which the company bought data from millions of Facebook accounts and processed that data AI/ML to determine sensitive information from users like political affliction and homosexuality. As a user of the social media platform, Facebook, this deeply concerns me to know that my “Activity” is being purchased and processed into sensitive information behind my back. I too, personally have experienced lack of privacy when I was in high school. While using or logging into district technology, I always see the “Managed by…” on every device, (including my personal devices). I was very curious as to what the district could manage, see, or block. My suspicions led me to investigate the systems that the school district had. During that process, I found a vulnerability in the main system directory that publicly displays personal information of faulty staff that worked in the district. That made me realize that sensitive information kept on a companies systems could be open to the public without the “average Joe” noticing. Not only is this why government interference should be required, but this means that the government should have privacy standards that companies need to comply with in order to prevent unknown and unauthorized access to personal information. After I graduated high school, I got the opportunity to work for that same school district’s IT department. I was excited to get to know how the back-end of districts IT systems worked but shocked when I learned what tools they used to spy on kids. The main tool they use for web-content management is an application called Securly. At first, I thought it was cool because it not only protects students from harmful content, but it could detect and send an alert if a student was suicidal so the district could help them. I did some more research on our systems and found out that the district collects information on every device it touches like location, websites, and even what a student is typing. The reason why everything is very unfriendly when it comes to privacy is because we need our systems to be FOIA-compliant. Before any privacy laws are passed, the government would need to make changes to FOIA laws so that companies/organizations can provide favorable privacy to users and still be able to submit FOIA request when needed.</p>

        <p>I disagree with the fact that consumers should just choose the companies that best protect their users. I believe in a free market with the exception to when it doesn’t work for the people. That is when Government needs to step in and take action. The CEO of one of the world’s biggest corporations even mentions it. In an interview with AXIOS, Tim Cook (CEO, Apple) says “we have to admit when the free market isn’t working…[in regards to user privacy]…it hasn’t worked”. </p>

        <p>Another thing that governments should do is to hire experts on security, encryption, data, and digital ethics to assist government officials in creating proper regulations and standards for companies to follow. Most governments (specifically the Unites States government) have a great amount of people that are not “tech-literate”. (talk about how US senators aren’t “tech-literate” and how embarrassing they sound when tech executives testify against congress)</p>
