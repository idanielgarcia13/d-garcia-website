        <h1>Government Interference should be Required to Protect User Privacy</h1>
        <p><small>By: Daniel Garcia</small></p>
        <img src="../../img/article-imgs/tech.jpg">
        <p>A growing number of companies are starting to be able to spy and collect private/sensitive information from consumers. A big “Privacy Awakening” happened during the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiy0a7Jk5HhAhUBYK0KHSQED_EQqQIIKSgAMAA&url=https://www.wired.com/story/cambridge-analytica-facebook-privacy-awakening/&usg=AOvVaw3QIR7DyGAADiTAv3-8Ed11">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> in which the company bought data from millions of Facebook accounts and processed that data with AI/ML to determine sensitive information from users like political affliction or sexual orientation. As a user of the social media platform, Facebook, this deeply concerns me to know that my “Activity” is being purchased and processed for other purposes without my knowledge or consent.</p>

        <p>I too, personally have experienced lack of privacy when I was in high school. While using or logging into district technology, I always saw the 	&quot;Managed by...&quot; on every device, (including my personal devices). I was very curious as to what the district could manage, see, or block. My suspicions led me to investigate the systems that the school district operated. During that process, I found a vulnerability in the main system directory that publicly displays personal information of faulty staff that worked in the district. That made me realize that sensitive information kept on a companies systems could be open to the public without anyone noticing. This why government regulations should be required. This means that the government should have privacy standards that companies need to comply with to prevent unknown and unauthorized access to personal information. After I graduated high school, I got the opportunity to work for that same school district&apos;s IT department. I was excited to get to know how the back-end IT systems worked but shocked when I learned what tools they used to spy on students. The main tool they use for web-content management is an application called <i>Securly</i>. At first, I thought it was great because it not only protects students from harmful content, but it could detect and send an alert if a student was suicidal so the district could help them. I did some more research on our systems and found out that the district collects information on every device it touches like location, websites, and even what a student is typing. The reason why everything is very unfriendly when it comes to privacy is that we need our systems to be <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/foia/foiatoc.htmlx">FOIA-compliant</a>. Before any privacy laws are passed, the government would need to make changes to FOIA laws so that companies/organizations can provide favorable privacy to users and still be able to submit FOIA request when needed. This is a good reason as to why government needs to step in to protect the privacy of their citizens.</p>

        <p>I highly disagree with the fact that consumers should just choose the companies that best protect their users. I believe in a free market with the exception to when it doesn&apos;t work for the people. That is when the Government needs to step in and take action. The CEO of one of the world&apos;s biggest corporations even mentions it. In an interview with <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-on-hbo-tim-cook-interview-apple-regulation-6a35ff64-75a3-4e91-986c-f281c0615ac2.html">AXIOS</a>, Tim Cook (CEO, Apple) says &quot;we have to admit when the free market isn’t working…[in regards to user privacy]…it hasn’t worked&quot;.</p>

        <p>Another thing that governments should do is to hire experts on security, encryption, data, and digital ethics to assist government officials in creating proper regulations and standards for companies to follow. Most governments (specifically the Unites States government) have a great number of people that <a href="#">are not &quot;tech-literate&quot;</a>.</p>

        <p>Some governments like the EU have implemented regulations to set rules on how corporations should be able to handle data. They also give companies a GDPR-compliant privacy notice template. The <a href="https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (known as GDPR) is a rule passed by the EU that should only apply to data that European Union citizens own but the internet is accessible to everyone (even people outside of the EU). The nice part about this regulation is that this would force companies in the United States to comply, therefore giving users a higher level of protection. The essential purpose of this law is to make a website to get crystal clear consent from that person that their data is being collected. The law also states that the company needs to have a method for a user to revoke their consent and request any data that the corporation has on that specific user (like Google Takeout). If companies don&apos;t comply with these laws, they will be fined $20 million or 4% of the company global turnover. This has proven to force many companies to introduce privacy standards and personal data tools.</p>

        <p>To conclude, Government interference is required to protect users privacy. The free market shouldn’t have to choose what companies better respect their users’ privacy. I believe it should be a standard as privacy is a human right.</p>
